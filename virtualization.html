  <h1>virtualization</h1>
  <p> In computing , <strong>virtualization</strong> refers to the act of creating a virtual <em>(rather than actual )</em> version of semething.  <br/>
  This includers virtual computer hardware ,virtual stronge devices and virtual net work resources .</p> <br/>
<hr>
  <h1> levels of virtualization </h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <strong> virtualization at Instruction set Architecture (ISA) level  </strong></li>
    <p> every machine has an instruction set .This instruction set in an interface between software and hardware . using this intructions softeware can <br/> communicate with hardeware </p>
    <li> <strong> virtualization at operating system (o.s.) level</strong></li>
    <p> In virtualization at hal level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.c. by installing O.S., application suites , networking systems ,ect . </p>
    <ul>
      <li> In cloud semetimes , we need to initializa 100 virtual machines at a single time , if we use virtualization at hardware abstraction layer<br/>(HAL)  level this can take too mach time </li>
      <li>SO, to overcome this in virtualization  at Ooerating system level we share operating system between virtual machines along with the <br/> hardware.</li>
    </ul>
